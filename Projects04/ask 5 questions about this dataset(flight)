## ask 5 questions about this dataset
data("flights")
data("airlines")

## select filter arrange mutate summarise count

## Q1. most flight carrier in Dec 2013
flights %>% 
  filter(month == 12, year == 2013)%>%
  count(carrier)%>%
  arrange(desc(n))%>%
  head(5) %>%
  left_join(airlines)

## Q2. top 5  flight to destination airport
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier, dest)%>%
  summarize(count = n())%>%
  arrange(desc(count))%>%
  head(5)%>%
  left_join(airlines)


## Q3. top 5 flight deparuture delay
flights %>%
  select(flight, carrier, tailnum, origin ,dest, dep_delay)%>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay))%>%
  left_join(airlines, by = c("carrier" = "carrier"))%>%
  head(5)
  

## Q4.average delay per flight on arrival

flights%>%
  filter(year == 2013)%>%
  group_by(carrier)%>%
  summarize(avg_arr_delay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = TRUE))

## Q5. How many flights on each carriers
flights %>%
group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(count = n())
